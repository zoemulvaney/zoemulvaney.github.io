### A Note on IDEs

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) isn't strictly necessary, but can make your life signifcantly easier.

* Dependency management
* Code completion
* Syntax hightlighting
* Debugging tools

### Domain Name White list

Please add your name and domain name onto [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBAQCh-eoaXOWpcf7MJzwcac6YvXnQXN08djvV-n7sA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Brackets

[Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) Download it if you haven't already.

### Browsers

Download all of them! Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Edge. Your site will be interpreted slightly differently in all of them. Sometimes it will be completely broken in one or more.

Chrome is now the most popular browser, thanks to Android. It **will** eat every scrap of RAM it can possibly access.

## Twitter Bootstrap

[TWB](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most well established front-end framework in an ever increasing herd. There are several other popular contenders namely:

* (Foundation)[https://foundation.zurb.com/]
* (Semantic UI)[https://semantic-ui.com/]

### Introduction to Grids

[Grid documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/)

### Project Directory Structure

Depending on the project requirements there is literally *hundreds* of perscribed project structures.

The following configuration is as "flat" as possible. Linking assets such as fonts and images to pages, will be straight forward

```
basic.com/
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── img
│   ├── bar.png
│   └── foo.png
├── js
│   └── script.js
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── gallery.html
└── index.html
```

## Hosting and Domain Management

How much time have you got and how deep are your pockets? As you're setting up a static website I recommend spending as *little* as possible. The only other consideration to bear in mind is email hosting.
