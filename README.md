### A Note on IDEs

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) isn't strictly necessary, but can make your life signifcantly easier.

* Dependency management
* Code completion
* Syntax hightlighting
* Debugging tools

### Domain Name White list

Please add your name and domain name onto [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBAQCh-eoaXOWpcf7MJzwcac6YvXnQXN08djvV-n7sA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Brackets

[Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) seems pretty cool, I'll check it out.

### VS Code

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has evolved into the *de facto* IDE for several languages. Support for the Javascript ecosystem is particularly strong. Intergrates well with githGb

### Git Version Control

Save yourself the nightmare of hundreds of folders with names like `final portfolio test v3 (final)`. Is it essential? No. Will it make your life easier? Yes, if you knock a cup of tea over your laptop and loose 3 weeks of work.

### Browsers

Download all of them! Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Edge. Your site will be interpreted slightly differently in all of them. Sometimes it will be completely broken in one or more.

Chrome is now the most popular browser, thanks to Android. It **will** eat every scrap of RAM it can possibly access.

## Twitter Bootstrap

[TWB](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most well established front-end framework in an ever increasing herd. There are several other popular contenders namely:

* (Foundation)[https://foundation.zurb.com/]
* (Semantic UI)[https://semantic-ui.com/]

### Overview

### Getting Started

### Project Directory Structure

Depending on the project requirements there is literally *hundreds* of perscribed project structures.

The following configuration is as "flat" as possible. Linking assets to pages 

```
basic.com/
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── img
│   ├── bar.png
│   └── foo.png
├── js
│   └── script.js
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── gallery.html
└── index.html
```

## Hosting and Domain Management

How much time have you got and how deep are your pockets? As you're setting up a static website I recommend spending as *little* as possible. The only other consideration to bear in mind is email hosting.
